# #What to expect:
# # 1. Know how to use input() function in appropriate ways
# # 2. Prompt the user for required input type
# # 3. Keep the program running as long as users want them to,
# # so that they can enter information as they need to
# # 4. Python while loops

# # HOW THE input() FUNCTION WORKS

# # Get the first joke from the user

# message = input("Tell me something funny, and I will tell you something "
#                 "even more funny: ")
# print(f"\nI found this to be interesting. Tell me,"
#       f" why did the chicken cross the road?")

# # Get the user's response (second joke)
# response = input("Enter your answer: ")

# # Print the second joke
# print(f"\nAh, I see! The chicken crossed the road because it wanted to "
#      "get to the other side. Classic! ðŸ˜„")

# print()

#     print("Why did the scarecrow win an award?")
#     input("Press Enter to reveal the answer...")  # Wait for user input
#     print("Because he was outstanding in his field! ðŸŒ¾")

# # Main interaction loop
# while True:
#     tell_joke()
#     respond_to_joke()

#     # Ask if the user wants to continue

# # prompt += "\n what is your name?"

# #First of all how does this work? I do not understand it at all.

# else:

# Be sure to convert input value from string to a numerical representation.

#THE MODULO OPERATOR: a useful numerical information  (%)
# This can be used to determine whether the number is odd or even.
# When the number is even, it returns 0 and when the number is odd, the function
# gives the remainder.
#Q: Of what use is this?
